### Privacy Policy

#### Introduction

Welcome to `next-fire-js`! This privacy policy outlines how we handle user data and privacy. We are committed to ensuring your privacy and protecting any information you provide while using our package. 

#### Data Collection

**No Data Collection**: `next-fire-js` does not collect, store, or process any personal data from users. Our package is designed to facilitate Firebase authentication with Next.js applications without tracking or storing any user information.

#### Use of OAuth

**OAuth Authentication**: Our package uses OAuth for authenticating users via Google. This process involves securely communicating with Google servers to authenticate user credentials. 

**No Tracking**: We do not track users during or after the authentication process. The OAuth flow is solely for the purpose of user authentication and session management within your application.

We prioritize security in our package design to ensure that the authentication process is safe and reliable. However, it is essential for users to follow best practices for securing their Firebase credentials and environment variables when using `next-fire-js`.

#### Third-Party Services

`next-fire-js` relies on Firebase for authentication services. Please refer to Firebase's privacy policy for more information on how they handle user data: [Firebase Privacy Policy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy).

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the updated date will be indicated at the top of the policy.
